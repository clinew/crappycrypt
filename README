So, I created this program because I was having trouble finding a statically-
compiled version of 'mkpasswd'; however, when verifying my results with
'mkpasswd' I learned that:

  1) 'mkpasswd' has a different concept of "rounds" than just merely running
     the same hash algorithm for the specified number of "rounds".
  2) The "rounds" option is a sort of hidden parameter when specifying the salt
     to crypt().

TL;DR: Don't use this program; it sucks and probably doesn't do what it's
supposed to.

Actually, now I have to wonder what exactly -are- the "rounds" in the crypt
program, because they sure as hell produce different outputs and have different
computation times!
